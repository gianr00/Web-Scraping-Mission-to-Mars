-    Visit the [Mars Facts site](https://galaxyfacts-mars.com) and use Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet such as diameter, mass, etc.
-    Visit the [astrogeology site](https://marshemispheres.com/) to obtain high-resolution images for each hemisphere of Mars.

2.    MongoDB and Flask Application
